# JavaScript Basics 

This repository contains my **first steps learning JavaScript**.

It includes a collection of beginner-level exercises focused on understanding the fundamentals of the language, such as variables, data types, operators, conditionals, user input, and basic calculations.

The goal of this repository is to:
- Practice core JavaScript concepts
- Get comfortable writing and running JavaScript code with Node.js
- Learn how to manage projects using Git and GitHub
- Track my learning progress from the very beginning

## Topics covered
- Variables and constants
- Data types
- Arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators
- User input using `prompt-sync`
- Type conversion (`parseInt`, `parseFloat`)
- Conditional logic
- Simple real-world calculations (BMI, discounts, temperature conversion)

## About this repository
This is a **learning repository**, not a production-ready project.  
The exercises are part of my JavaScript learning journey and represent my early practice with the language.

Feel free to explore the code and follow along with my progress 🙂
